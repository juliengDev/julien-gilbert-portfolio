Welcome to my interactive 2D portfolio! In this unique experience, you can explore a virtual house and discover various elements about my work. As you navigate through the rooms, youâ€™ll find different pieces of information and interactive elements showcasing my projects, skills, and achievements.

The portfolio is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience across devices, from desktop to mobile. Built using JavaScript, it offers an interactive and visually appealing way to learn more about what I do.
